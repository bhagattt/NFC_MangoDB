% of expenditure of the marriage was supposed to be contributed by your

ceremony was born by father of my client.

house without any reasonable cause. 
8) That my client states that after your leaving from matrimonial home, my 
client and his parents personally visited your parental home and made 
sincere efforts to persuade you to return & reconcile to the matrimonial 
home, however, you and your father demanded that you would not 
resume matrimonial home unless a separate flat was arranged for you, 
subsequently dated 18/09/2024 father of my client took 1BHK flat on 
rent of Rs. 9000/- monthly with deposit of Rs. 30000/-(Rupees Thirty 
Thousand) in same building (C/402, Marigold, Yashwant Nagar – 
Virar-west) to fulfil your demand and with hope that you both spouse 
reconcile and would lead happy married life.  
9) That my client states that dated you resumed matrimonial home in rented 
flat with my client, even after shifting the rented flat still your behave did 
not improve , you continued to engage in quarrels, arguments, and 
domestic disturbances with my client over petty and trivial matters on 
daily basis, for instance, once upon time, dated 12/11/2024  my client had 
taken you for outing and movie, and at the time of returning from the 
movie, your in-laws offered you to join the family for dinner but in 
response you deliberately jumped off a moving two- wheeler,  and 
again within some days of said  incident you left matrimonial home 
without just or reasonable cause, such act of you clearly establishes

                         Opp Bank of Baroda, Borivali (West), Mumbai-4000092.   
 
                    Mobile No-  9137205098                                                       Email-meenabhagat459@gmail.com  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
lack of maturity and a deliberate intention to harass my client and his 
parents, which constitutes mental cruelty upon your spouse and in-laws 
within meaning of law, additionally during said period, due to your own 
negligence , you conceived and became two months pregnant, you later 
stated that a miscarriage had occurred ; however , the surrounding 
circumstances indicate that it was an induced abortion.  
10) That furthermore, my client states that from past seven months you 
are at your paternal home, my client and his parents made number of 
genuine efforts to make you to understand and resume the matrimonial 
home but  you stated to my client that "तरी औकात ही नही ह मझ रखन 
की", such act of you amounts to mental agony to my client, despite my 
client’s father offered you and your father to have sound & healthy 
meeting and counselling through Samaj namely श्री क्ष य घांची समाज 
सस्था वरार  for amicable reconciliation, but you and your parents denied 
for said meeting, hence facts, circumstances and wilfully deserted the 
matrimonial home without just and sufficient cause exhibit your 
irresponsible, immature and threatening behaviour, on contrary  my client 
and his parents made several bona fide efforts to enable you to resume 
the matrimonial home, but such efforts did not yield any positive result.  
11) That my client states that you have placed an unreasonable and 
unlawful condition upon my client that unless my client purchases a  
2 BHK flat fitted with furniture & AC in your name, you will not resume 
cohabitation or return to the matrimonial home, this amounts to mental 
cruelty and contrary to the spirit and sanctity of marriage, marriage 
relationship cannot be weighted with unreasonable term and condition.

12) That your act of withdrawal from matrimonial society without any just 
& reasonable cause amounts to desertion, and your present demands are 
legally untenable, coercive, and indicative of material motives behind 
marital relations. 
13) That my client states that he still willing and eager to resume marital 
life with you provided  you return unconditionally to the matrimonial 
home because my client is belonging to the average  financially family 
background, he is not able to afford your demand of 2BHK flat to be 
purchased on your name near to your parental home, such demand and 
conduct amounts to mental cruelty and breach of the foundational trust 
that is inherent in a matrimonial relationship.  
 
Therefore, through this notice, you are called upon to resume 
cohabitation and fulfil your matrimonial obligations within 15 days from 
the receipt of this notice, failing which my client shall be compelled to 
take appropriate legal recourse by filing a petition under section 9 of the 
Hindu Marriage Act before the competent Family Court at your cost and 
risk. 
This notice is being sent to you without prejudice to any other legal 
remedies to my client under law.
